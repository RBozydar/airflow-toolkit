# terragrunt_infrastructure_live

This directory is intended to keep your terraform code DRY using terragrunt. If you follow the traditional terraform-only approach, you will duplicate your code multiple times.

There is a simple dev example, and you can mirror the folder structure for other environments like QA and PROD.
